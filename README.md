# ProjetMachineLearning

Explore our machine learning project where we used Python and data analysis/machine learning libraries to determine whether customers are VIP or not.

## Machine Learning Project - ProjetMachineLearning
This project, named "ProjetMachineLearning," was designed to determine whether customers are VIP or not using Python and data analysis/machine learning libraries.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this machine learning project was to develop models capable of predicting whether customers are VIP or not based on specific data.

## Technologies Used:
-Jupyter Notebook
-Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, stats_desc, scipy, scikit-learn

## Model Type:
We developed logistic regression and random forest models to address this prediction problem.

## Dataset:
We utilized an original dataset comprising three tables: clients, tickets, and stores. The tables were in CSV format, with approximately 850,000 rows, 600,000 rows, and 60 rows respectively.

## Data Preprocessing:
We began by analyzing the data structure. Subsequently, we performed preprocessing steps such as data cleaning and normalization.

## Model Evaluation:
To assess the performance of our models, we employed standard measures such as accuracy score, area under the ROC curve (AUC), ROC curve, and confusion matrix.

## Results:
Our models achieved satisfactory results with both algorithms, although logistic regression exhibited a slight advantage.

## Possible Improvements:
Being our first project, we have yet to identify specific improvements, but we are open to exploring enhancement possibilities in the future.
